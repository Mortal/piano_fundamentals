Fundamentals of Piano Practice
==============================

All the efficient piano practice methods I could find have been assembled in this one book, starting with the teachings of Mlle. Yvonne Combe. Included are the material from over fifty of the most popular books on learning piano, and hundreds of articles and internet sites, that are relevant to practice methods.

Combe's grandmother was a famous soprano in France and Combe's mother was a voice teacher and they gave Yvonne a good start in piano. Yvonne won the first prize for piano at the Paris Conservatory in 1910 and graduated at age 13. Franz Liszt had attracted high level pianists to Paris and the "French School of Piano/Music" developed some of the most advanced teaching methods. Combe's mentors were Long, Cortot, Debussy, and Saint Saëns. She helped Debussy transcribe his new compositions for publication as he played them out on the piano. Debussy even added some of Combe's suggestions into his compositions. She was one of the most promising pianists of her time, concertizing and performing under famous conductors such as Saint Saëns, until she injured her hand in a bicycle accident (she was quite an athlete, a good skier), ending her performing career at age 15. She subsequently dedicated her entire life to teaching, organizing schools with up to 30 teachers in England, Switzerland, and Plainfield, NJ, USA, where she briefly coached Van Cliburn because her teaching methods were similar to his mother's.

Piano pedagogy had incorrectly attributed success in piano to "talent" for over a hundred years, thus relieving teachers of the responsibility for the failure of their students. This mistake stagnated teaching until about year 2000, when information became readily available over the internet. Today, talent is being replaced by knowledge, empowering students to quickly learn piano skills that were previously considered the exclusive "talents" of "geniuses" that, we now know, can be easily taught. Piano pedagogy can finally catch up to established fields of study that have proper textbooks that provide teachers with all necessary material that should be taught, enabling every student to learn at rates that were impossible during the age of exercises (Hanon) and "lesson pieces" (Czerny) devoid of music. Piano lessons are all about learning the "genius skills", project management, empowerment through education and, above all, making music.
